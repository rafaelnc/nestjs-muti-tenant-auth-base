## 🚀 Base Project with Turborepo, NestJS Multi-Tenants, and React + Vite Frontend.<br>
This is a base project designed to serve as a starting point for other projects, leveraging the benefits of a monorepo with Turborepo, a robust backend architecture with NestJS and multi-tenancy support, and a modern frontend using React with Vite.<br>

## 📚 Overview<br>
This project is crafted to facilitate the development of scalable and modular applications, providing a solid foundation and best practices for rapid project development.<br>

## 🧩 Project Structure<br>
Monorepo with Turborepo: Manages multiple packages within a single repository, streamlining code organization and maintenance.<br>
Backend with NestJS:<br>
Multi-Tenants: Supports multiple tenants, allowing a single backend instance to serve various databases or configurations.<br>
Modular Architecture: Clear separation between modules, services, controllers, and entities for scalability and parallel development.<br>
Frontend with React + Vite:<br>
Vite: An ultra-fast and lightweight build tool for React projects.<br>
Modular Components: Organization of React components to be reusable and easy to maintain.<br>
